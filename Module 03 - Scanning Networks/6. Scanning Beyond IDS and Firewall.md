## 1. What Does "Scanning Beyond IDS/Firewall" Mean?

In the scanning phase, attackers frequently encounter defensive controls:

| Defense | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Firewall** | Filters packets based on rules — blocks unauthorized traffic |
| **IDS** | Detects suspicious patterns — logs and alerts |
| **IPS** | Detects *and* actively blocks attacks in real time |

These controls can:
- Block probe packets entirely
- Detect and alert on scan activity
- Log attacker IP addresses and actions
- Rate-limit or throttle connection attempts

**Evasion** is the art of modifying scanning techniques to collect the same intelligence while **avoiding triggering these controls**.

> 🧠 **Mental Model:**
> - Normal Scanning → *"Find open doors"*
> - Evasion Scanning → *"Find open doors without triggering the alarm"*

---

## 2. IDS vs. Firewall vs. IPS — The Key Differences

This distinction is **exam-critical** and frequently tested in CEH.

| Device | Primary Role | Action Taken | Traffic Path |
|--------|-------------|:------------:|:------------:|
| **Firewall** | Enforce access control policy | Block / Allow packets | Inline — traffic passes through |
| **IDS** | Detect suspicious behavior | Alert / Log only | Out-of-band — monitors a copy of traffic |
| **IPS** | Detect and respond | Block + Alert | Inline — traffic passes through |

> 🎯 **CEH Memory Rule:**
> - **Firewall** → *Gatekeeper* — decides what gets in/out
> - **IDS** → *Security Camera* — watches and records, doesn't stop
> - **IPS** → *Security Guard* — watches AND physically stops threats

### IDS Detection Methods

| Detection Type | How It Works | Evaded By |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Signature-Based** | Matches traffic against known attack patterns | Fragmentation, obfuscation |
| **Anomaly-Based** | Flags deviations from normal baseline behavior | Slow scanning (timing evasion) |
| **Stateful Protocol Analysis** | Tracks protocol state and flags violations | Protocol-compliant evasion |

---

## 3. Why Attackers Use Evasion Techniques

According to the CEH module, the goal is to **continue gathering information even when security controls are present**.

| Attacker Objective | Evasion Technique |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Avoid IDS signature alerts | Packet fragmentation |
| Hide true attacker identity | Decoy scanning, IP spoofing |
| Prevent IP-based blocking | Idle/zombie scanning |
| Bypass firewall ACL rules | Source port manipulation |
| Evade threshold-based IDS | Timing-based (slow) scanning |
| Bypass deep packet inspection | Protocol manipulation |

---

## 4. Evasion Techniques Overview

| Technique | What It Does | Evades | Nmap Flag |
|-----------|-------------|--------|:---------:|
| **Packet Fragmentation** | Splits packets into tiny pieces | Signature-based IDS | `-f` |
| **Decoy Scanning** | Mixes real IP with fake decoy IPs | IP-based blocking | `-D` |
| **IP Spoofing** | Forges source IP address | Simple IP filters | `-S` |
| **Idle / Zombie Scan** | Uses third-party host as proxy | All logging/attribution | `-sI` |
| **Timing Evasion** | Slows scan below IDS thresholds | Rate-based IDS detection | `-T0` to `-T2` |
| **Source Port Manipulation** | Uses trusted port (e.g., 53) as source | Naive firewall rules | `--source-port` |
| **IP TTL Manipulation** | Crafts TTL so probes die before IDS | IDS positioned beyond router | `--ttl` |
| **Bad Checksum Packets** | Sends packets with invalid checksums | IDS that accepts bad TCP checksum | `--badsum` |
| **Custom Offsets** | Fragments with specific offsets | Some detection engines | `--mtu` |

---

## 5. Packet Fragmentation

### 📌 Concept

Breaks full-size TCP packets into **small fragments** — each fragment is too small to contain a complete attack signature. A signature-based IDS that inspects individual fragments never sees the complete pattern to match against.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```
Normal packet (all inspection data in one packet):
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  IP Header │ TCP Header │ Payload (full data) │  ← IDS matches signature ✅
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Fragmented packets (signature split across fragments):
┌────────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│  IP │ Fragment 1   │  │ IP │ Fragment 2    │  │ IP │ Fragment 3  │
│  (8 bytes data)    │  │ (8 bytes data)    │  │ (remaining data) │
└────────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
   Individually harmless — IDS can't match the full signature
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Commands

```bash
# Standard fragmentation (8-byte fragments)
nmap -f <target>

# Double fragmentation (16-byte fragments)
nmap -ff <target>

# Custom fragment size (must be multiple of 8)
nmap --mtu 16 <target>

# Fragment with SYN scan
sudo nmap -sS -f <target>
```

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Evades** | Signature-based IDS, legacy firewalls |
| **Fails against** | Modern IDS with fragment reassembly (e.g., Snort with stream5) |
| **Impact on speed** | Slight slowdown — more packets to send |
| **Detection risk** | Excessive fragmentation itself can trigger IDS alerts |

> ⚠️ **CEH Key Fact:** Modern IDS systems like **Snort** can reassemble fragmented packets before inspection — making this technique less effective against up-to-date defenses.

---

## 6. Decoy Scanning

### 📌 Concept

The attacker sends scan probes that appear to **originate from multiple IP addresses** — mixing the real attacker's IP among a crowd of fake "decoy" addresses. The target and its defenders receive scan traffic from many apparent sources and cannot easily identify the actual attacker.

### ⚙️ How Decoy Scanning Works

```
Real Attacker: 10.10.5.1

Without decoy:    10.10.5.1 → Target    ← Obvious single source

With decoys:      10.10.5.1 → Target    ← Real attacker hidden
                  192.168.1.5 → Target  ← Decoy 1
                  172.16.3.8  → Target  ← Decoy 2
                  10.0.0.99   → Target  ← Decoy 3
                  ...
                  Defender sees: "Scan from 50 different IPs — which is real?"
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Commands

```bash
# 10 random decoy IPs (RND = random)
nmap -D RND:10 <target>

# Manually specify decoy addresses
nmap -D 192.168.1.5,10.0.0.3,172.16.0.7 <target>

# ME keyword to explicitly place real IP in decoy list
nmap -D 192.168.1.5,ME,10.0.0.3 <target>

# Decoy + SYN scan
sudo nmap -sS -D RND:15 <target>
```

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Evades** | IP-based blocking; forensic attribution |
| **Does NOT evade** | IDS that inspects content (decoys still send valid probes) |
| **Limitation** | Decoy IPs must be routable to avoid broken traffic patterns |
| **Detection** | Defenders may flag correlated scans from many IPs simultaneously |

> ⚠️ **Critical CEH Distinction:** Decoy scanning **hides your identity** but does **not prevent detection** — traffic is still seen; it's just harder to attribute.

---

## 7. Spoofed Source IP Scanning

### 📌 Concept

The attacker **forges the source IP address** in their outgoing packets — making probes appear to come from a different host entirely.

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -S <spoofed-IP> -e <interface> <target>
```

### Hping3 IP Spoofing

```bash
# Spoof source IP
hping3 -S --spoof <spoofed-IP> -p 80 <target>

# Randomize source IP per packet
hping3 -S --rand-source -p 80 <target>
```

### ⚠️ Major Limitation — Why It Often Fails

```
Spoofed IP scan:
Attacker (10.10.5.1) sends SYN from spoofed IP (1.2.3.4) → Target

Target replies SYN-ACK to 1.2.3.4 (the spoofed IP, not the attacker!)
                                      ↑
                                Attacker never receives response!
```

| Scenario | IP Spoofing Outcome |
|----------|:------------------:|
| TCP scanning (stateful) | ❌ Breaks — responses go to spoofed IP |
| UDP scanning (stateless) | ⚠️ Partially works — no reply expected |
| ICMP flood / DoS attacks | ✅ Works — no response needed |
| Idle/Zombie scan (uses spoofing correctly) | ✅ Works — by design |

> 🎯 **CEH Exam Favorite:** IP spoofing frequently appears in questions about limitations. The key point is that it **breaks TCP communication** and responses go to the wrong host.

---

## 8. Idle Scan (Zombie Scan)

### 📌 Concept

The **most stealthy** scanning technique available. The attacker never directly communicates with the target — instead they exploit a third-party **"zombie"** (idle) host as an unwitting intermediary. The target's logs show only the zombie's IP — the real attacker is effectively invisible.

### ⚙️ How the Idle Scan Works — Step by Step

```
Actors:
  Attacker:  10.10.5.1
  Zombie:    10.10.2.9  (idle host with predictable IP ID)
  Target:    10.10.1.11

Step 1: Attacker probes zombie → gets current IP ID (e.g., IP ID = 30000)
         Attacker → SYN/ACK → Zombie → RST (reveals IP ID = 30000)

Step 2: Attacker sends SYN to target, SPOOFING zombie's IP as source
         Attacker → [Source: Zombie IP] → SYN → Target

Step 3A: If target port is OPEN:
         Target → SYN-ACK → Zombie (zombie didn't initiate → sends RST → IP ID increments to 30001)

Step 3B: If target port is CLOSED:
         Target → RST → Zombie (zombie ignores it → IP ID stays at 30000)

Step 4: Attacker probes zombie again → checks new IP ID
         IP ID = 30001 → PORT OPEN ✅ (IP ID incremented by 1)
         IP ID = 30000 → PORT CLOSED ❌ (IP ID unchanged)
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
# Basic idle scan
sudo nmap -sI <zombie-host> <target>

# Idle scan with specific port on zombie
sudo nmap -sI <zombie-host>:<zombie-port> <target>

# Find good zombie candidates (need predictable IP ID)
nmap -O --script ipidseq <zombie-candidate>
```

### 📊 Idle Scan Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Stealth level** | 🟢 Maximum — attacker's IP never appears in target logs |
| **Target visibility** | Only sees zombie's IP |
| **Zombie requirement** | Must have **predictable/incremental IP ID** sequence |
| **Complexity** | High — three-party coordination required |
| **Speed** | Slow — requires multiple round trips per port |
| **Best zombie candidates** | Network printers, idle workstations, old servers |

> 💡 **Finding a Good Zombie:** The zombie host must have a **predictable IP ID sequence** (increments by 1 per packet). Run `nmap -O --script ipidseq <host>` to test candidates.

---

## 9. Timing-Based Evasion

### 📌 Concept

**IDS systems detect scans by recognizing rapid connection bursts** — many probes in a short time window. By slowing down the scan, the attacker keeps probe rates below IDS detection thresholds, blending into normal background traffic.

### 🛠️ Nmap Timing Templates

```bash
# Very paranoid (slowest, most stealthy)
nmap -T0 <target>

# Sneaky
nmap -T1 <target>

# Polite (good balance)
nmap -T2 <target>

# Normal (Nmap default)
nmap -T3 <target>

# Aggressive (fast, noisy)
nmap -T4 <target>

# Insane (fastest, most detectable)
nmap -T5 <target>
```

### 📊 Timing Template Comparison

| Level | Name | Delay Between Probes | Best For |
|:-----:|------|:-------------------:|---------|
| **T0** | Paranoid | 5 minutes | Maximum stealth; IDS evasion |
| **T1** | Sneaky | 15 seconds | Slow, covert scanning |
| **T2** | Polite | 0.4 seconds | Reduced detection risk |
| **T3** | Normal | Default adaptive | Standard balanced scan |
| **T4** | Aggressive | Minimal | Fast scanning on reliable networks |
| **T5** | Insane | Near zero | Speed; no stealth concern |

### Custom Timing Control

```bash
# Set maximum rate (packets per second)
nmap --max-rate 5 <target>

# Set minimum delay between probes
nmap --scan-delay 2s <target>

# Set max retransmission attempts
nmap --max-retries 1 <target>
```

> 🎯 **CEH Rule:** Slower scan = harder to detect. T0 (Paranoid) is the most stealthy timing option.

---

## 10. Source Port Manipulation

### 📌 Concept

Some firewalls are configured to **allow traffic from certain trusted source ports** (e.g., DNS uses port 53, which many admins whitelist). By setting the scan's source port to a trusted value, the attacker's probes may bypass naive firewall rules.

### 🛠️ Nmap Commands

```bash
# Use DNS port as source
nmap --source-port 53 <target>

# Alternative syntax
nmap -g 53 <target>

# Use FTP data port
nmap --source-port 20 <target>
```

### Hping3 Source Port Manipulation

```bash
# Set source port to 53 (DNS)
hping3 -s 53 -S -p 80 <target>

# Kerberos source port
hping3 -s 88 -S -p 445 <target>
```

### 🎯 Commonly Trusted Source Ports

| Port | Service | Why It's Trusted |
|:----:|---------|-----------------|
| **53** | DNS | Many firewalls allow DNS traffic freely |
| **20** | FTP Data | Legacy allowlist on older configs |
| **88** | Kerberos | Trusted in Active Directory environments |
| **80** | HTTP | Outbound HTTP often whitelisted |
| **443** | HTTPS | Outbound HTTPS almost universally allowed |

> ⚠️ **Limitation:** Modern **stateful firewalls** track connection state — they inspect *who initiated* the connection, not just the port number. Source port manipulation is far less effective against stateful inspection engines.

---

## 11. Hping3 for Evasion

**Hping3** is the manual packet crafter of choice for firewall testing and evasion because it allows full control over every header field.

### 🎯 Key Evasion Capabilities

| Capability | Hping3 Method |
|------------|--------------|
| Custom flag crafting | `-S`, `-A`, `-F`, `-P`, `-U` flags |
| IP fragmentation | `-f` or `--frag` |
| Source IP spoofing | `--spoof <IP>` |
| Random source IP | `--rand-source` |
| Source port control | `-s <port>` |
| TTL manipulation | `--ttl <value>` |
| Firewall ACK probe | `-A -p 80` |
| Covert channel | Data tunneled in packet payloads |

### 🛠️ Key Hping3 Evasion Commands

```bash
# ACK probe — tests if firewall is stateful
hping3 -A <target> -p 80

# Fragmented packets
hping3 -S -f <target> -p 80

# Spoof source IP
hping3 -S --spoof 192.168.100.5 -p 80 <target>

# Randomize source IP
hping3 -S --rand-source -p 80 <target>

# Source port from DNS
hping3 -s 53 -S -p 80 <target>

# Custom TTL (reaches target but dies before IDS positioned deeper)
hping3 -S --ttl 3 -p 80 <target>

# Slow flood for timing evasion
hping3 -S -p 80 --faster <target>
```

### ACK Probe — Firewall Rule Inference

```bash
hping3 -A <target> -p 80
```

| Response | Firewall Inference |
|----------|:-----------------:|
| **RST received** | No stateful firewall — path is unfiltered |
| **No response** | Stateful firewall dropping unsolicited ACKs |

---

## 12. Additional Evasion Techniques

### 🔹 IP TTL Manipulation

```bash
# Set TTL so packets die before reaching IDS (positioned deeper in network)
nmap --ttl 5 <target>
```

If an IDS is positioned **beyond** a certain number of hops, crafting a TTL that expires before reaching the IDS — but still reaches the target — can blind the IDS to your probes.

### 🔹 Bad Checksum Packets

```bash
# Send packets with intentionally invalid TCP checksum
nmap --badsum <target>
```

Some older IDS implementations accept and inspect packets even with invalid checksums. If the IDS processes them but the target drops them, the attacker can map IDS vs. firewall filtering behavior.

### 🔹 Random Data Payload

```bash
# Append random data to packets to confuse signature matching
nmap --data-length 25 <target>
```

Pads packets with random bytes — signatures expecting exact packet sizes may fail to match.

### 🔹 MAC Address Spoofing

```bash
# Spoof MAC address on LAN
nmap --spoof-mac 0 <target>       # Random MAC
nmap --spoof-mac Apple <target>   # Vendor-specific MAC
```

Useful for LAN-layer evasion and bypassing MAC-based access control lists.

### 🔹 Proxy / VPN Tunneling

Route scan traffic through **proxy chains** or **VPN** to further obscure the true origin:

```bash
# ProxyChains + Nmap (route through SOCKS proxy)
proxychains nmap -sT <target>
```

> ⚠️ ProxyChains works only with **TCP Connect** scans (`-sT`) — raw packet scans cannot be proxied.

---

## 13. Blue Team — Detection & Countermeasures

Understanding how defenders detect evasion techniques is just as important as knowing how to use them.

| Evasion Technique | How Defenders Detect It | Countermeasure |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Packet Fragmentation** | Fragment reassembly in IDS (Snort stream5) | Modern IDS reassembles before inspection |
| **Decoy Scanning** | Correlated simultaneous scans from many IPs | Geo-anomaly detection; flow analysis |
| **IP Spoofing** | Ingress/egress filtering (BCP38); anti-spoofing | ISPs filter spoofed packets at edge |
| **Idle/Zombie Scan** | IP ID sequence analysis; asymmetric traffic | Randomized IP ID sequences on hosts |
| **Slow Scan (T0/T1)** | Extended baseline monitoring; long-window detection | Correlate over hours/days, not seconds |
| **Source Port Abuse** | Stateful inspection; port + state validation | Next-gen firewalls ignore source port tricks |
| **Bad Checksum** | Drop invalid packets; log anomalies | Strict packet validation at perimeter |
| **MAC Spoofing** | 802.1X port authentication; dynamic ARP inspection | Switch-level port security |

### 🛡️ Key Defensive Tools

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Snort** | Signature + anomaly IDS with fragment reassembly |
| **Suricata** | High-performance IDS/IPS with multi-threading |
| **pfSense / iptables** | Stateful packet filtering firewall |
| **Zeek (Bro)** | Network behavioral analysis and logging |
| **SIEM** | Correlates events across time windows to catch slow scans |

## 15. CEH Exam Traps & Tips

| ⚠️ Exam Trap | ✅ Correct Understanding |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Fragmentation defeats all IDS** | ❌ False — modern IDS reassemble fragments before inspecting |
| **Decoy scan hides you completely** | ❌ False — scan is still detected; only the source is obscured |
| **IP spoofing enables full TCP scanning** | ❌ False — breaks TCP (responses go to spoofed IP, not attacker) |
| **Idle scan is detectable at the target** | ❌ False — target only sees the zombie's IP; attacker is invisible |
| **T0 is the fastest Nmap timing** | ❌ False — T0 (Paranoid) is the **slowest and most stealthy** |
| **Source port manipulation fools modern firewalls** | ❌ False — stateful firewalls ignore source port tricks |
| **IDS = Firewall** | ❌ False — IDS only detects; firewall enforces rules |
| **IPS is out-of-band** | ❌ False — IPS is **inline** (traffic passes through it); IDS is out-of-band |
| **Slow scans are always undetectable** | ❌ False — SIEMs can correlate events over long time windows |
| **Zombie must be on the same subnet** | ❌ Not required — zombie just needs a predictable IP ID and internet reachability |
| **`-D` flag spoofs the source IP** | ⚠️ No — `-D` adds **decoys** around your real IP; use `-S` to spoof the source |
