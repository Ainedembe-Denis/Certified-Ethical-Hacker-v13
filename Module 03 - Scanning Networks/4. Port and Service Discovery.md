## 1. What is Port and Service Discovery?

**Port and service discovery** is the process of probing a live target to identify:

| What Is Discovered | Why It Matters |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Open ports** | Active communication channels — potential entry points |
| **Closed ports** | Port accessible but no service listening |
| **Filtered ports** | Firewall or ACL blocking the probe |
| **Running services** | What application is behind the port |
| **Service versions** | Exact version numbers for CVE matching |

Performed **after host discovery**, port scanning reveals the accessible attack surface of a confirmed live system.

> 🧠 **Mental Model:**
> - Host Discovery → *"Who is alive?"*
> - Port Discovery → *"What doors are open — and what's behind them?"*

### Why This Phase Is Critical to Attackers

| Goal | How Port Discovery Helps |
|------|--------------------------|
| Find exposed services | Reveals what's listening on which ports |
| Detect unnecessary open ports | Highlights misconfigurations |
| Find vulnerable applications | Service versions map directly to CVEs |
| Verify firewall policy | Filtered vs. open shows what security controls exist |
| Prepare for exploitation | Open + versioned = ready-to-exploit |

---

## 2. Where It Fits in the Scanning Workflow

```
Footprinting (Passive Recon)

```

> 📌 **CEH Exam Rule:** You **cannot** meaningfully port scan until you have a confirmed live host list. The sequence is always: Host Discovery → Port Scan → Service Detection.

---

## 3. Understanding Port States

Nmap classifies every port it probes into one of six states. Correctly interpreting these is fundamental to the CEH exam.

| Port State | Meaning | What It Tells the Attacker |
|:----------:|---------|---------------------------|
| **Open** | A service is actively accepting connections | 🎯 Potential entry point — investigate further |
| **Closed** | Host is reachable, but no service is listening | ✅ Host is alive; port may open later |
| **Filtered** | Firewall/ACL is blocking probe responses | 🛡️ Security device present — harder to probe |
| **Unfiltered** | Port reachable but state is indeterminate | ⚠️ Needs further testing (ACK scan result) |
| **Open\|Filtered** | No response received; could be either | ❓ Common with UDP and stealth scans |
| **Closed\|Filtered** | Cannot determine if closed or filtered | ❓ Rare; typically seen in IP ID idle scan |

### 🎯 Quick Response-to-State Decoder

| Response Received | Likely Port State |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| **SYN-ACK** | Open |
| **RST** | Closed |
| **No response (timeout)** | Filtered or Open\|Filtered |
| **ICMP Unreachable** | Filtered |

> 💡 **Memory Trick:** *"RST = Rejected = closed. Silence = suspicious = filtered or open."*

---

## 4. TCP Connect Scan — Full Open

The most straightforward scan — completes the **full TCP three-way handshake** before immediately closing the connection.

### ⚙️ How the Three-Way Handshake Works

```
Scanner → SYN  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target
Scanner ←← SYN-ACK ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Target   [Port is OPEN]
Scanner → ACK  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target   [Connection Established]
Scanner → RST  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target   [Scanner closes connection]

— OR —

Scanner → SYN  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target
Scanner ←← RST ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Target   [Port is CLOSED]
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sT <target>
```

Scan specific ports:
```bash
nmap -sT -p 22,80,443,3389 <target>
```

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Reliability** | Very high — uses OS TCP stack |
| **Stealth** | ❌ Low — full connection logged by target |
| **Privilege Required** | None — works without root/admin |
| **Speed** | Moderate — full handshake overhead |
| **Detectability** | Easily detected by firewalls and IDS |

### ✅ Best Used When

- No root/administrator privileges available
- Accuracy is more important than stealth
- Testing through application-layer proxies

---

## 5. TCP SYN Scan — Half-Open

> 🔥 **The most important port scanning technique for the CEH exam.**

Performs a **partial handshake** — sends SYN, receives SYN-ACK, then immediately resets with RST **without completing the connection**. This is why it's called a *half-open* or *stealth* scan.

### ⚙️ How the Half-Open Handshake Works

```
Scanner → SYN  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target
Scanner ←← SYN-ACK ←←←←←←←←←←←← Target   [Port is OPEN ✅]
Scanner → RST  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target   [Cut connection — never logged!]

— OR —

Scanner → SYN  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target
Scanner ←← RST ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← Target   [Port is CLOSED ❌]

— OR —

Scanner → SYN  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→ Target
[No Response / Timeout]                     [Port is FILTERED 🛡️]
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sS <target>
```

> 📌 `-sS` is the **default Nmap scan** when run with root/administrator privileges.

```bash
# Scan top 1000 ports with SYN scan
sudo nmap -sS <target>

# SYN scan with version detection
sudo nmap -sS -sV <target>
```

### 📊 Response Summary

| Target Response | Port State |
|:--------------:|:----------:|
| **SYN-ACK** | ✅ Open |
| **RST** | ❌ Closed |
| **No response** | 🛡️ Filtered |

### ✅ Why the SYN Scan Is #1

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Faster than connect scan** | No full handshake overhead |
| **More stealthy** | Connection never completed — less likely to be logged |
| **Less logging on target** | Many services only log completed connections |
| **Default Nmap scan** | Goes-to method in real-world pen testing |

### ⚠️ Requirement

> Requires **root or administrator privileges** to craft raw packets.

---

## 6. UDP Scan

UDP is used by critical services (DNS, SNMP, DHCP, TFTP) that are often overlooked — making UDP scanning a valuable attack vector.

### ⚙️ Response Logic

```
Scanner → UDP probe → Target port

Possible outcomes:
┌───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┐
│ Response                  │ Port State                    │
├───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│ UDP reply received        │ ✅ Open                        │
│ ICMP Port Unreachable     │ ❌ Closed                      │
│ No response               │ ❓ Open | Filtered             │
│ ICMP Host/Net Unreachable │ 🛡️ Filtered                   │
└───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sU <target>
```

Combined UDP + SYN scan:
```bash
sudo nmap -sU -sS <target>
```

Target common UDP services:
```bash
nmap -sU -p 53,67,68,69,123,161,500 <target>
```

### 🎯 Critical UDP Ports to Know

| Port | Service | Why Attackers Target It |
|:----:|---------|------------------------|
| **53** | DNS | Zone transfers, DNS poisoning |
| **67/68** | DHCP | Rogue DHCP server attacks |
| **69** | TFTP | Unauthenticated file transfer |
| **123** | NTP | NTP amplification DDoS |
| **161** | SNMP | Community string brute force, info disclosure |
| **500** | IKE/IPSec | VPN enumeration |

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Speed** | ❌ Very slow (no connection confirmation) |
| **Reliability** | ❌ Unreliable — silence is ambiguous |
| **Privilege Required** | Yes (raw socket needed) |
| **Important for** | DNS, SNMP, DHCP, TFTP discovery |

---

## 7. FIN Scan

Sends a TCP packet with **only the FIN flag set** — an unusual packet that exploits RFC 793 compliance to infer port state without initiating a connection.

### ⚙️ How FIN Logic Works (RFC 793 Behavior)

```
RFC 793 Rule:
→ If a closed port receives an unexpected segment (like FIN),
  it MUST respond with RST.
→ If an open port receives unexpected FIN (no session),
  it silently drops the packet.

Scanner → FIN → Target

[RST received]    = Port CLOSED ❌
[No response]     = Port OPEN ✅ (or filtered 🛡️)
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sF <target>
```

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Stealth** | 🟢 High — no SYN packets, harder to detect |
| **Reliability** | ⚠️ Medium — depends on RFC compliance |
| **Windows behavior** | ❌ Broken — Windows sends RST for ALL ports (open or closed), making results unreliable |
| **Linux/Unix** | ✅ Works correctly |

> ⚠️ **Critical Exam Note:** FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans **do not work reliably on Windows systems**. Windows violates RFC 793 by sending RST for both open and closed ports.

---

## 8. NULL Scan

Sends a TCP packet with **no flags set at all** — the most abnormal packet possible. RFC 793 behavior is the same as FIN scan.

### ⚙️ Response Logic

```
Scanner → TCP (no flags) → Target

[RST received]    = Port CLOSED ❌
[No response]     = Port OPEN ✅ or FILTERED 🛡️
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sN <target>
```

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Flags Set** | None (0x000) |
| **Stealth** | 🟢 High — very unusual packet, may evade simple rule sets |
| **IDS Evasion** | May bypass detection since no valid TCP flags are set |
| **Windows** | ❌ Unreliable (same issue as FIN scan) |

---

## 9. Xmas Scan

Sets **three flags simultaneously** — FIN, PSH, and URG — making the packet "light up like a Christmas tree." Named for the festive bit pattern.

### ⚙️ Response Logic

```
Scanner → TCP [FIN + PSH + URG] → Target

[RST received]    = Port CLOSED ❌
[No response]     = Port OPEN ✅ or FILTERED 🛡️
```

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sX <target>
```

### Hping3 Equivalent

```bash
hping3 -F -P -U <target> -p 80
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|:----:|---------|
| `-F` | FIN flag |
| `-P` | PSH flag |
| `-U` | URG flag |

### 📊 Characteristics

| Characteristic | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Flags Set** | FIN + PSH + URG (0x029) |
| **Stealth** | 🟢 High — unusual flag combo may evade signature-based IDS |
| **Windows** | ❌ Unreliable (same RFC violation issue) |
| **Named For** | All flags "lit" like Christmas lights |

---

## 10. Stealth Scan Comparison — FIN vs NULL vs Xmas

These three scans share identical response logic but differ in flag patterns. Together they form the **"stealth trio"** of CEH port scanning.

| Attribute | FIN Scan | NULL Scan | Xmas Scan |
|-----------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| **Nmap Flag** | `-sF` | `-sN` | `-sX` |
| **TCP Flags Set** | FIN | None | FIN + PSH + URG |
| **Open Port Response** | No response | No response | No response |
| **Closed Port Response** | RST | RST | RST |
| **Works on Windows?** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Works on Linux/Unix?** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Stealth Level** | 🟢 High | 🟢 High | 🟢 High |
| **IDS Evasion** | Moderate | High | Moderate |

> 🎯 **CEH Memory Rule:** *All three stealth scans say:*
> - **Silence = Open (or filtered)**
> - **RST = Closed**
> - **Don't use on Windows**

---

## 11. Service Version Detection

Once open ports are found, attackers perform **banner grabbing and service probing** to extract exact application names and version numbers — enabling precise CVE matching.

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -sV <target>
```

Intensity levels (0–9, higher = more aggressive):
```bash
nmap -sV --version-intensity 9 <target>
```

Only confirm if service version matches a pattern:
```bash
nmap -sV --version-light <target>
```

### 📊 Example Output

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5
80/tcp   open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.49
443/tcp  open  https    nginx 1.18.0
3306/tcp open  mysql    MySQL 5.7.36
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt   Microsoft Terminal Services
```

### 🎯 Why Version Detection Is Devastating

| Discovered Version | Known Exploit |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **Apache 2.4.49** | CVE-2021-41773 — Path Traversal / RCE |
| **OpenSSH < 7.7** | CVE-2018-15473 — Username Enumeration |
| **SMBv1 (Windows)** | MS17-010 — EternalBlue / WannaCry |
| **MySQL 5.x** | CVE-2012-2122 — Authentication Bypass |
| **vsftpd 2.3.4** | CVE-2011-2523 — Backdoor (shell on port 6200) |

> 💡 **Attacker's Goal:** Version number → CVE lookup → Exploit selection. This is why `-sV` is run in virtually every real-world engagement.

### Manual Banner Grabbing

```bash
# Netcat
nc -nv <target> 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0

# Telnet
telnet <target> 25

# curl (HTTP headers)
curl -I http://<target>
```

---

## 12. Aggressive Scan — Combined Mode

The `-A` flag combines **four powerful techniques** into a single command — the all-in-one reconnaissance blast.

### 🛠️ Nmap Command

```bash
nmap -A <target>
```

### 📊 What `-A` Enables

| Technique | Flag Equivalent | What It Does |
|-----------|:--------------:|-------------|
| **OS Detection** | `-O` | Fingerprints OS via TCP/IP stack behavior |
| **Service Version Detection** | `-sV` | Identifies exact service versions |
| **NSE Script Scanning** | `-sC` | Runs default Lua scripts (vuln checks, info gathering) |
| **Traceroute** | `--traceroute` | Maps network path to target |

### 📊 Example Output Snippet

```
OS details: Linux 4.15 - 5.6
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   RSA 2048 ...
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.49
|_http-title: Company Intranet Portal
TRACEROUTE (using port 80/tcp)
HOP RTT     ADDRESS
1   1.20ms  192.168.1.1
2   5.45ms  10.0.0.1
```

### ⚠️ Warning — High Noise Level

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Very noisy** | Generates significant traffic volumes |
| **Easily detected** | Triggers IDS/IPS signatures immediately |
| **Not stealthy** | Avoid on monitored networks unless stealth is irrelevant |
| **Logs on target** | Full connections are established for version detection |

> 💡 **When to use `-A`:** Internal audits, CTF challenges, or when speed matters more than stealth. Never use in covert engagements.

## 14. Tools for Port and Service Discovery

| Tool | Type | Key Strength | Source |
|------|:----:|-------------|--------|
| **Nmap** | CLI Scanner | The gold standard — every scan type, scripting engine, OS detection | [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org) |
| **Hping3** | CLI Crafter | Manual packet crafting — custom flags, firewall testing | [https://salsa.debian.org/debian/hping3](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/hping3) |
| **Metasploit** | Framework | Auxiliary scanner modules — TCP, UDP, service-specific | [https://www.metasploit.com](https://www.metasploit.com) |
| **RustScan** | CLI Scanner | Ultra-fast pre-scan; pipes discovered ports into Nmap | [https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) |
| **NetScanTools Pro** | GUI Suite | Windows GUI combining ping, port scan, DNS, WHOIS | [https://www.netscantools.com](https://www.netscantools.com) |
| **MegaPing** | GUI Scanner | Windows GUI; ping sweep + port scan + NetBIOS all in one | [http://magnetosoft.com](http://magnetosoft.com) |

### 🔥 RustScan — Speed Boosted Nmap Workflow

RustScan scans all 65,535 ports in seconds, then passes discovered open ports directly into Nmap for detailed analysis:

```bash
# Install via Docker
docker pull rustscan/rustscan:latest

# Scan and pipe into Nmap
rustscan -a <target> -- -sV -sC

# Scan all ports, then aggressive Nmap
rustscan -a 10.10.1.11 --range 1-65535 -- -A
```

> 💡 RustScan turns a 17-minute full-port Nmap scan into ~15 seconds. Use it to discover ports fast, then let Nmap do the detailed fingerprinting.

## 16. CEH Exam Traps & Tips

| ⚠️ Exam Trap | ✅ Correct Understanding |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **SYN scan = same as Connect scan** | ❌ No — SYN never completes the handshake; Connect does |
| **SYN scan needs no privileges** | ❌ False — requires root/admin for raw packets |
| **UDP scan is fast** | ❌ False — UDP is the **slowest** scan type |
| **RST always means filtered** | ❌ False — RST usually means **closed** |
| **Silence = open port** | ⚠️ Depends on scan type — in FIN/NULL/Xmas, yes; in SYN scan, no (silence = filtered) |
| **FIN/NULL/Xmas work on Windows** | ❌ False — Windows sends RST for all ports, breaking stealth scan logic |
| **Version detection `-sV` is stealthy** | ❌ False — version detection makes full connections and is easily detected |
| **`-A` flag is one technique** | ❌ False — `-A` enables 4 techniques: OS detection, version, NSE scripts, traceroute |
| **Open\|Filtered means definitely open** | ❌ No — it means the scanner couldn't determine the state |
| **Nmap SYN scan is default always** | ⚠️ Only when run with root privileges; without root it falls back to `-sT` |
